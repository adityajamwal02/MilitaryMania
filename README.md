# PREFACE
KEY CONCEPT || ALGORITHMIC DEVELOPMENT FOR INDIAN MILITARY AT TERROR-PRONE REGIONS


# Introduction

•	The Global Terrorism Index (GTI) is a comprehensive study analyzing the impact of terrorism for 163 countries covering 99.7 per cent of the world’s population.

•	The GTI scores each country on a scale from 0 to 10; where 0 represents no impact from terrorism and 10 represents the highest measurable impact of terrorism.

•	Currently, India standing at Top 12th position with GTI of 7.432 index on scale of 10. The annual report suggests that the maximum cases of terror activities are concentrated in major parts of Jammu & Kashmir.

•	Our software lends a hand to solve such issues and reduce the GTI (India) fairly, making it a scope for military aspects.


# Objectives

1)	The main objective of the project is to develop software that facilitates various set of problems including day to day military operations and war surgical strike times.

2)	To develop software which is capable to find the 
•	optimal solution (war operations) and 
•	satisfying solution (daily operations).

3)	Consisting of a collection of various approaches: 
	Divide & Conquer (Sorting and Searching)  Based on Terror groups/ District Searching/Sorting.
	Greedy Techniques Dijkstra (Single source Shortest), Fractional Knapsack, Welsh-Powell Algorithm (Graph-Vertex Coloring Optimal), Chromatic number count.
	Backtracking Techniques  Escape Path (Bombing Conditions).
	Dynamic Programming  Flyod-Warshall Algorithm (All Pairs shortest path), Minimum Weaponry cost (Wines Problem)


# Future Scope
Being technological strong is one the key reason to have a dominating military. Having solutions to any possible outcomes with minimal residual cost and time would help the military build stronger dominance. Whereas the same applies for offence. 
Building a planned strategy with best suited algorithms help to achieve more and lose less especially during critical times such as wars itself. Further scope of this project could be proper visualization helping the users to illustrate and demonstrate algorithms more efficiently. 
This project could be of significance use with proper GTI and APIs using, mapping systems and locational coordinates, supply dates and medical checkpoints.
